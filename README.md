POC to use Google's [release-please github action](https://github.com/google-github-actions/release-please-action) to create releases.

## Take into account

- It is highly recommend that you use squash-merges when merging pull requests (ser more details [here](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please#linear-git-commit-history-use-squash-merge)).
